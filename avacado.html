                Avocado cake is a cake prepared using avocado as a primary ingredient, together with other typical cake ingredients. The avocados can be mashed, and may be used as an ingredient in cake batter, in cake toppings and alone atop a cake. Cake variations include raw avocado cake, avocado brownies and avocado cheesecake. Raw, uncooked versions of avocado cake can be high in vitamin E and essential fatty acids, which are derived from avocado. Avocado-based cake toppings include avocado fool and avocado crazy.
