    <h3>
            A cupcake (also known as a fairy cake) is a small cake designed 
            to be eaten by one person, 
            baked in a thin paper wrapper, and decorated with frosting on 
            top.

                One of the mainstays at Coffee &amp; Cake is our famous Red Velvet 
                Cupcake. A well-guarded recipe combined with the natural ingredients 
                make this little red rascal unapologetically delicious. 
                Topped with decorative vanilla frosting, the Red Velvet 
                Cupcake is a favorite among kids as well.
